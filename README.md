Ormuco python test

Question A

There are two main functions for this question, order and isOverlap. For order function, it swaps the pair if it is not in order. Then the isOverlap function is to check whether the two lines overlap. There are two cases, either line1 is on the left of line2 or line1 is on the right of line2. For other cases, the two lines overlap. It returns False if two lines don't overlap, returns True if they overlap.

Question B

For this question, I used re library to split strings into small parts by '.'. Then next step is to compare two version strings. I gave some test cases that I can think of.

Missing functionalities:
When it compares a negtive number with a positive number, for example -1.1 and 1.1, the result should be -1.1 is less than 1.1 rather than -1.1 is equal to 1.1

Question C

For this question, I used OrderedDic.

Missing functionalities:
Time expiration
